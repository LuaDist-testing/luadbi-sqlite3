= Dependencies =

Before attempting to build LuaDBI the development libaries for each database
must be installed. For Debian/Ubuntu systems, the list of required dependancies
are:

 * libsqlite3-dev
 * libmysqlclient15-dev
 * libpq-dev
 * db2exc (optional for DB2 support)
 * oracle-xe-client (optional for Oracle support)

= Building =

Run `make` (or `make free`) in the source directory to build the Open Source
database drivers. To build the drivers for DB2 and Oracle, run `make all`.

== Windows ==

Inside the vc++ directory are build projects for Visual C++ to build LuaDBI
for Windows.

= Make Targets =

 * make free - builds MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 drivers
 * make all - as above, but also builds DB2 and Oracle drivers
 * make mysql
 * make psql
 * make sqlite3
 * make db2
 * make oracle

= Make Targets (install) =

 * make install_free - builds and installs MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 drivers
 * make install_all - as above, but also builds and installs DB2 and Oracle drivers
 * make install_mysql
 * make install_psql
 * make install_sqlite3
 * make install_db2
 * make install_oracle

= Installation =

Please consult your distributions documentation on installing Lua modules.
Please note that both the database binary driver packages (*.so|*.dll) and DBI.lua
must be installed correctly to use LuaDBI
